## üéØ About Me

Welcome to my developer website! I'm an experienced Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for building incredible user experiences that address customer pain points and improve product usability, ultimately driving brand loyalty. I love companies that solve everyday problems for customers, and I have engineering experience in the finance, personal banking, and healthcare sectors. 

I currently live in the great state of Pennsylvania with my beautiful family, where I work remotely. I am absolutely blessed that I can be there for my family 24/7. When I am not working, or spending quality time with my wife, son, and dog, I maintain diverse set of hobbies and interests. I'd call myself a jack-of-all-trades, but my name isn't Jack! These include: Muay Thai, Taekwondo, cooking/grilling, pinball and slot machines, antiques, landscaping and horticulture, aquarium keeping, home improvement and DIY projects, woodworking, Rubik's cubes and other like-puzzles, and video games.

This website is meant to serve as a fun CV and a means of getting to know me. If you are interested, please free to contact me for a professional copy of my resume.

## üíº Professional Experience

### üè• Medefy - Software Engineer III
**üóìÔ∏è Feb. 2024 - Present** | Remote/Tulsa, OK

- üéØ Researched and implemented [FeatBit](https://featbit.co) feature management. Integrated the Featbit SDK into an internal shared services package, created a docker-compose file to run Featbit locally, and deployed Featbit to our production kubernetes cluster via Helm charts managed by ArgoCD.
- üéØ Collaborated closely with our seniormost engineer to implement [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) observability via OpenTelemetry into our kubernetes clusters and configured our logger to support the OpenTelemetry log transporter.
- üéØ Created a Next.js project foundation for the new version of our core operational technology - an internal admin dashboard that our Care Team will use to service customer chats, and management will use to configure new clients.
- üéØ Implemented the UI designs for a new virtual telehealth appointment scheduling flow into our mobile app. Streamlined the UI component hierarchy and enforced best React practices, while delivering the completed interface ahead of schedule and under tight deadlines.
- üéØ Stood up the first version of our Care Assistant, a Flask API that receives a chat message, contextualizes the conversation via customer plan information read from an internal Knowledge Base, and returns an appropriate LLM-generated response from Meta's Llama3. The API was built with an MVCS framework to keep business/control logic separate from service logic.
- üéØ Developed a companion Flask API to the Care Assistant to capture metrics from the Care Team's usage of the LLM-driven responses, and integrated the metrics capturing API into our internal chat management dashboard.
- üéØ UI redesign work on customer data and prescription information modules that are iFramed into our chat management dashboard.

## üï∞Ô∏è Past Projects

### ü¶â [Campus Owl](https://github.com/petergramenides/campus-owl)
**üß∞ Built with:** ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?style=flat-square&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Angular-DD0031?style=flat-square&logo=angular&logoColor=white) ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express.js-000000?style=flat-square&logo=express&logoColor=white) ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-47A248?style=flat-square&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)  
A campus-focused social media platform allowing students to share info about events, clubs, meetups, and other interest groups. It was built for a term project in Web Science Systems Development at RPI. The web app featured an event feed where you could make posts about upcoming events. You were able to create an account, make posts, add likes and comments to posts, and follow other users.

### üìÖ RSRV
**üß∞ Built with:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Flask-000000?style=flat-square&logo=flask&logoColor=white) ![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React%20Native-61DAFB?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=black) ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Postgres-336791?style=flat-square&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)   
The project repo has since been taken down, but this was a project built for my Software Design and Documentation class at RPI. I served as the lead backend developer, and built the Flask APIs for our one-size-fits-all reservation app. Our primary use cases were targeting restaurants, barbers, and hair and nail salons. Through a React Native mobile app (cross platform), you could locate nearby businesses and schedule appointments based on the times they had listed under their business' profile.
